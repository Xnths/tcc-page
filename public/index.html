        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The development of augmented reality applications is characterized by high variability, technical constraints, and frequent environmental change. In the absence of an explicit development process, such variability tends to generate disorganized practices that fail to produce software increments with observable value for the client. This work describes the advancements on the case study MatematecAR and examines agile software development as a set of rules interpreted by Skinner's behavioral analysis psychology.

        <h2>Final Follow-up</h2>
        <p>
            After evaluating the challenges of AR development, the project was forced to
            change its focus. The absence of a formal development methodology prevented
            the application from evolving as expected, resulting in months of effort with
            little progress toward viable prototypes or meaningful testing. Consequently,
            the initial proposal was compromised, motivating a shift in emphasis toward
            restructuring and improving the development process itself.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="acompanhamento-1">
        <h2>First Follow-up</h2>
        <p>
            Initially, Professor Colli was already developing an AR application for the
            Matemateca. The idea did not originate with the authors of this work. Some
            implementation attempts had already been made. After a few conversations,
            it was verified that there was a project in Unity using Vuforia. As the main
            requirement is to perform tracking of the exhibited pieces, the chosen
            plugins satisfied this demand. For this purpose, <i>image tracking</i> was
            used with QR Codes, a technique that consists of identifying an image and
            defining it as a reference for positioning 3D models. However, this does
            not solve other problems, such as the fragility of the tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vuforia is an SDK in Unity and has some functionalities restricted to its
            usage plans. With it, one can implement an AR application and already model
            3D objects within the tool itself. In addition, there are broad options of
            features to implement an AR scene. Although it enables the simplification
            of several development processes, the main concern regarding its use is
            versioning. We will still explore how to handle this if we choose to adopt
            this development method. However, we want to avoid it, as it deviates
            somewhat from the scope of classic mobile application development that we
            learned in the computer science course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given this estrangement, we ventured into other frameworks and languages.
            Initially, we sought an API with a native library for mobile AR development.
            We found two, namely ARCore and ARKit. There are limitations regarding their
            use, since although ARKit is more robust than ARCore, it lacks Android
            compatibility. Not only that, when testing development with ARCore, it was
            possible to observe the aversion of the Unity project owners to the
            complexity of developing in Android Native. Therefore, we soon changed our
            strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, we changed the approach once again. As React is widely known in the
            market, we created a new repository using React Native. With it, it is
            possible to develop mobile applications for Android and iOS. This solution
            expands the availability of the application and facilitates its
            development, since it is familiar to developers. Therefore, we continued
            development with it to test its limitations.

        <h2>Work Proposal</h2>
        <h3 id="proposta-introducao">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            In contemporary times, interactive digital products saturate the daily
            lives of all global demographics. In particular, mobile applications
            contribute to users’ comfort, learning, and recreation. Technology even
            extrapolates the virtual world and merges with the material world. QR Codes,
            for example, assist in digital communication. One simply points the camera
            and the device interacts with reality, directing the user to the virtual
            world.
        </p>
        <p>
            This blend has become clearer with advances in computer vision techniques.
            Inevitably, applications centered on this technology have emerged. Thus, we
            have objects from the virtual world that interact with the physical world
            and vice versa. At the British Museum, for example, it is possible to rent a
            tablet with a customized application installed on the device. With it,
            visitors can obtain more information about the exhibits by using the
            device’s camera.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no need to distance ourselves from the national context. Professor
            Giselle Beiguelman from the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism (FAU - USP)
            carried out the demonumentaRA project. Analogous to the British museum,
            augmented reality was used to blend the physical and the virtual. However,
            the purpose was different. Instead of augmenting physical objects, the
            professor proposed bringing architectural monuments to be placed on the
            university campus. Thus, signs were installed at the Clock Square indicating
            their “existence.” To the unsuspecting passerby, nothing is observed. It was
            necessary for the observer to install the application developed by FAU in
            order to see the objects. Through the camera, the models appeared as if they
            were actually in the physical space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inserted into this context, the same technology is integrated into
            education. The Matemateca, as a small mathematical museum, plans to take
            advantage of augmented reality. The interactive pieces already serve the
            purpose of materializing mathematical abstractions for its non-academic
            visitors. However, with AR it will be possible to achieve many other
            advances to support this initiative. This expands design options, proposing
            new ways to interact and learn.
        </p>

        <h3 id="proposta-contexto">Context</h3>
        <p>
            At the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, since 2003, a collection of
            interactive objects has been built. Over the years, professors, students,
            and artisans have contributed by complementing this small museum with
            playful boards, geometric shapes, and demonstrations of mathematical
            concepts, whose mysteries—veiled in equations, philosophies, and
            abstractions—are unveiled before visitors. Although the project has
            volunteer monitors who mediate visits, their permanent presence is
            unfeasible. In fact, having someone available throughout the entire period
            in which the Matemateca is installed at the institute is not possible, since
            it may remain for days or even months without any forecast of removal from
            the lobby of Block B.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, there is a need for alternatives for mediation. With this in
            mind, Professor Eduardo Colli consolidated a project to integrate AR
            (Augmented Reality) into the pieces. Together with Lab3D, development of an
            application using Unity with Vuforia began. This simpler option, more
            accessible to people outside computer science, seemed like an initial
            alternative. However, the development flow with this tool cannot be
            sustained to become a mobile application with continuous delivery (CI/CD).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is therefore desired to adopt more rigorous development methods. By
            applying computer vision concepts and adopting good practices for large-
            scale software development, this work aims to collaborate with the
            Matemateca project, contributing so that computing serves the social
            purpose of integration with the community external to the University of
            São Paulo.
        </p>

        <h3 id="proposta-cronograma-resumido">Summary Schedule</h3>
        <p>
            Initially, the intention is to take advantage of what has already been
            defined previously. Thus, we will begin by studying the limitations of the
            technology so that it is accessible to the general public. This means that,
            by the end of this project, we want to make available an application that
            can be used on common smartphones without excluding any user due to
            operating system– or sensor-based functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
            Afterwards, we want to define the scenes to be implemented. Design
            decisions will involve collaboration with the Lab 3D team and guidance
            from Professor Eduardo Colli. Although it is not the focus, we will be
            concerned with following good usability practices. This means that we will
            take care to refine any proposed idea before proceeding to implementation.
            Finally, it is essential to follow agile methodologies. Therefore, we will
            have sprints that will be documented on the TCC website.
